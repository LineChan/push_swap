PUSH SWAP 

-- SUBJECT --
============

Push_swap is a sorting game thats requires two programs :
- push_swap : You only have two stacks to sort the puzzle. At first, a stack (called stack_a) contains a certain amount of unduplicated integers and a second one (stack_b) is empty.





-- METHOD --

-- sort 3 elem with less than 3 moves : sort_three

-- sort 7 elem with less than 12 moves : sort_seven (using sort_three)

-- sort 20 elem with less than x moves : insert_sort (using sort_three)

-- sort 100 elem with less than 900 moves : quick_sort

-- sort 500 elems with less than x moves : quick_sort 




-- SPEC ---

---> example "advanced" parsing :  0 "4 2" 1 6"    3  7" 8

---> -clean : remove all redondant moves (ex : pb then pa)
